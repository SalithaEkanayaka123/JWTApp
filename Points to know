1. Since we have added spring security dependency, when we run the application and type localhost:8080/ we navigate to a login page in browser
2. But by adding the SecurityConfiguration file and run (Code should be implmented as Initial Commit and commit 2) we dont need a login it will go to the whitelist page without login
3. We have added a login form given by spring security and instead of given password we have added our own username and password and password is encrypted
